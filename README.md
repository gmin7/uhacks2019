# NoteThisBoard
Living in the big city, we're often conflicted between the desire to get more involved in our communities, with the effort to minimize the bombardment of information we encounter on a daily basis. NoteThisBoard aims to bring the user closer to a happy medium by allowing them to maximize their insights in a glance. This application enables the user to take a photo of a noticeboard filled with posters, and, after specifying their preferences, select the events that are predicted to be of highest relevance to them.
